    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yummy Japanese croquettes combine ground beef with mashed potatoes and onions; formed into patties, then coated with panko and deep fried to a golden brown. Absolutely mouth-watering! They make a delicious snack. I prefer to make them in smaller bite-sized pieces so it's easier to pick up with fingers. Serve with Tonkatsu sauce available at Japanese stores or major supermarkets.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium russet potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 onions, chopped</li>
        <li><sup>3/4</sup> pound ground beef</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>All purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li><sup>1/2</sup> cup oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add potatoes to a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil; cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and pour potatoes into a large bowl. Stir in butter and mash with a fork or potato masher. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions and cook until soft. Stir in beef and soy sauce. Cook, stirring continuously, until beef is browned and all the liquid is evaporated. Combine beef and onions with potatoes, and stir well.</li>
        <li>Heat <sup>1/2</sup> cup oil in a deep skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Shape potato and beef mixture into 10 similarly sized balls, then flatten into patties. Dredge patties in flour, then dip in egg, and coat with panko bread crumbs. Carefully place patties into oil and fry until golden brown on each side.</li>
    </ol>
